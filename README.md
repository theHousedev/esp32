# Making An IoT Device
This project began because I want to set up an automated garden/yard watering controller my parents can use from the comfort of the home, rather than going out in the rain to shut off an active water timer.

The root of the project is writing some lightweight C++ to control a simple relay board, plus a bit of hardware architecting.

The frontend design is TBD.
